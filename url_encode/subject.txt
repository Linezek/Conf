    Vous devez realiser un programme qui prend en parametre une chaine de
caractere et qui affiche cette chaine de caractere sur la sortie standard apres
avoir ete URL encode.
sur la sortie standard.
    Pour savoir comment URL encoder une chaine de carctere, vous devrez suivre
les indications fournies dans l'extrait de la RFC 1738 fournie ci-dessous. Une
regle optionnelle non documentee dans ce document definit que dans une chaîne 
de caractere URL encode le caractere espace ' ' peut etre remplace par le
caractère plus '+'. Pour le programme que vous devez realiser, cette regle
n'est pas optionnelle et devra etre toujours appliquee.
    Les caracteres converti en hexadecimal devront toujours etre remplaces par
des codes hexadecimaux comportant uniquement des lettres majuscules.
    Les caracteres alpha-numeriques ne doivent jamais etre convertis 
([a-zA-Z0-9]).
    Si la chaîne de caractere passee en parametre a votre programme est vide,
vous devrez afficher sur la sortie standard le caractere '\n'.
     Si aucun argument n'est passe a votre programme, votre programme devra
afficher sur la sortie standard le caractere '\n'.

Exemples :

$./url_encode "ceci est un test"
ceci+est+un+test

$./url_encode "ceci est un test" | cat -e
ceci+est+un+test$

$./url_encode "Plus dur : '/*+-#'"
Plus+dur+%3A+%27%2F*%2B-%23%27

$./url_encode "" | cat -e
$

$./url_encode "Flop" "flop..."  | cat -e
$

Extrait de la RFC 1738 "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)":

> 2.2 URL Character Encoding Issues
> 
>     URLs are sequences of characters, i.e., letters, digits, and special 
> characters. A URLs may be represented in a variety of ways: e.g., ink on 
> paper, or a sequence of octets in a coded character set. The interpretation
> of a URL depends only on the identity of the characters used.
> 
>     In most URL schemes, the sequences of characters in different parts of a 
> URL are used to represent sequences of octets used in Internet protocols.
> For example, in the ftp scheme, the host name, directory name and file names
> are such sequences of octets, represented by parts of the URL. Within those
> parts, an octet may be represented by the chararacter which has that octet
> as its code within the US-ASCII [20] coded character set.
> 
>     In addition, octets may be encoded by a character triplet consisting of
> the character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits (from 
> "0123456789ABCDEF") which forming the hexadecimal value of the octet. 
> (The characters "abcdef" may also be used in hexadecimal encodings.)
> 
>     Octets must be encoded if they have no corresponding graphic character 
> within the US-ASCII coded character set, if the use of the corresponding 
> character is unsafe, or if the corresponding character is reserved for some
> other interpretation within the particular URL scheme.
> 
>     No corresponding graphic US-ASCII:
> 
>     URLs are written only with the graphic printable characters of the 
> US-ASCII coded character set. The octets 80-FF hexadecimal are not used in
> US-ASCII, and the octets 00-1F and 7F hexadecimal represent control
> characters; these must be encoded.
> 
>     Unsafe:
> 
>     Characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons. The space character is
> unsafe because significant spaces may disappear and insignificant spaces may
> be introduced when URLs are transcribed or typeset or subjected to the
> treatment of word-processing programs. The characters "<" and ">" are unsafe
> because they are used as the delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote
> mark (""") is used to delimit URLs in some systems. The character "#" is
> unsafe and should always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and
> in other systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that
> might follow it. The character "%" is unsafe because it is used for
> encodingsof other characters. Other characters are unsafe because gateways
> and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify such characters.
> These characters are "{", "}", "|", "\", "^", "~", "[", "]", and "`".
> 
>     All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL. For example,
> the character "#" must be encoded within URLs even in systems that do not
> normally deal with fragment or anchor identifiers, so that if the URL is
> copied into another system that does use them, it will not be necessary to
> change the URL encoding.
> 
>     Reserved:
> 
>     Many URL schemes reserve certain characters for a special meaning: their
> appearance in the scheme-specific part of the URL has a designated semantics.
> If the character corresponding to an octet is reserved in a scheme, the octet
> must be encoded. The characters ";", "/", "?", ":", "@", "=" and "&" are the
> characters which may be reserved for special meaning within a scheme. No
> other characters may be reserved within a scheme.
> 
>     Usually a URL has the same interpretation when an octet is represented by
> a character and when it encoded. However, this is not true for reserved
> characters: encoding a character reserved for a particular scheme may change
> the semantics of a URL.
> 
>     Thus, only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and
> reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used unencoded
> within a URL.
> 
>     On the other hand, characters that are not required to be encoded
> (including alphanumerics) may be encoded within the scheme-specific part of a
> URL, as long as they are not being used for a reserved purpose.
